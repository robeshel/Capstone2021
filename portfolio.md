# Projects
### Deep Space Propulsion Group
### **Description**  
  The scope of this project is to establish an environment that resembles the conditions of deep space to allow the team to test and research ion engines before 
  sending any prototypes there. This environment can be achieved by using a vacuum chamber. There are many systems that must be put into place in order to ensure 
  the safety and efficiency of our research. They are as follows: an adjustable thruster mount, propellant supply lines, vacuum-system support structure, 
  corrosion shielding, and data acquisition.

### **Data Acquisition Subsystem**
  The Data Acquisition Subteam works to create a system of digital and analog input and output signals in order to collect and observe relevant data to the project. 
  It is vital to the progress of this research to be able to understand what methods lead to beneficial results. 
  Given powerful enough data acquisition infrastructure, it is possible to find correlations between individual changes of input to the system with better 
  individual outputs of the system. This leads to a better design. To take this to another level, machine learning algorithms are strong tools which can be used
  to feed outputs back into the system in order to quickly find correlations. The method for data acquisition uses sensors and data acquisition devices. 
  Factors such as temperature, pressure, mass flow, etc. are all points of research.

#### **Technologies Used**  
  - Python
  - WinDaq
  - SpiceLT
  
## Personal Projects
### 1. LED Light Programming  
#### **Description**  
  This project entailed adding various lighting patterns and differing settings/presets to strands of programmable LED lights. The code was flashed on to an Arduino
  that ran a pre-made source code to handle the setup of the lights. I was able to create several different light patterns and experiment with timings, movement, and
  other aspects of the lights.  
#### **Technologies Used**  
  - Arduino IDE
  - Arduino board
  
### 2. Magic Mirror  
#### **Description**  
  The Magic Mirror was a large, hand-made mirror with a one-way mirror that had a monitor mounted to the back controlled by a Raspberry Pi. A preset program was
  loaded on to the Raspberry Pi that started the mirror and displayed a blank canvas, then several modules were added created in Bash to add various functions to the mirror,
  such as the time of day, weather, calendar, daily quotes and many other types of modules. This gave me more experience with Bash and integrated systems like the Raspberry Pi.  
#### **Technologies Used**  
- Raspberry Pi
- Bash scripts
